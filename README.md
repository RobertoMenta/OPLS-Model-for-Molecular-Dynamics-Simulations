# OPLS-Model-for-Molecular-Dynamics-Simulations
Analysis scripts and input files to reproduce simulations of the research activity conducted by R. Menta at Princeton Univeristy for Master Thesis project.
The Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on clusters were performed for a system of 64 hydrogen peroxide molecules within a cubic box of periodic boundary conditions.
The model used is the OPLS force field which is formed by intermolecular interactions: LJ interaction + Coulomb interaction.
We didn't see the symmetry-breaking phase transition. And we suggest that is was hided by the liquid-glass first-order transition due to the hydrogen bonds formation driven by the electrostatic interaction.
